### What is TooMaNyBiNds?
---
This Team Fortress 2 game script allows you to toggle a whole new set of keyboard binds with a press of a button. This means that each key now can have 2 different binds. Unfortunately this script only supports the keypad, every single key on the keypad except the Num Lock key.

There are two different sets of binds; the main binds (binds with the alternate binds off) and the alternate set of binds.

### Installation
If you do not have a file called autoexec.cfg, make a new file called autoexec.cfg and place it into your TF2 directory. See below for information on how to do this.

### Editing
**Only edit the "Binds" section in the script.** Each alias has a name of a key after the command say, it represents which key the alias is binded to. Input your bind to each alias. Remember to leave a space after the say command in order for this to work eg. `say Conga Fortress 2`.

### Toggle Key
Look for the following line in the script and replace "KEY" to a key to toggle TooMaNyBiNds
```
bind "KEY" toggleTooMaNyBiNds
```

### Creating autoexec.cfg: (only if you do not have autoexec.cfg in your TF2 Directory)
1. Open Notepad
2. File > Save As...
3. Under `File Name` type in `autoexec.cfg`
4. Below it there is `Save as Type` and it should say `Text Documents (*.txt)`. Click it and choose `All Files` and save it into your TF2 directory.

### TF2 Directory Location
